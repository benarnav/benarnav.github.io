New York City has the most extensive public transportation system in the United States, but due to its age (over 100 years old!) it is frequently in need of major maintenance which disrupts or delays service. To avoid needlessly waiting for trains on the platform, this display shows the next two trains traveling in one direction (the way I'm usually going) from the station closest to my apartment. Pushing the built-in Up button on the microcontroller displays the next four trains going in both directions.

The default screen also shows the time, temperature and AQI level. The AQI icon is color coded to signal the recommendations put out by the US gov. The subway line icons (known as 'bullets' in official parlance), will flash an alert symbol if the transit agency has issued an alert for that line. Pushing the onboard Down button will scroll the alerts along the bottom of the display.
