<h2>hi, i'm benjamin</h2>

I'm a data scientist who likes to tell stories.

<font color='yellow'><h4>!-This website is currently under construction-!</h4></font>

You can [e-mail me](mailto:contact_arnav.cc80e@aleeas.com) if you would like to chat about
new projects, cycling, [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKgYJnBCjXk) or ways to make the world a better place for all humans.

If you're wondering "Does this site look like this on purpose? You seem technically capable...", 
the answer is yes! It's a nod to web 1.0 design of the 90s. Everything old is new again; time is a flat circle.
