<h2>hi, i'm benjamin</h2>

I'm a data scientist who likes to tell stories.

You can [e-mail me](mailto:contact_arnav.cc80e@aleeas.com) if you'd like to chat about
new projects, cycling, [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKgYJnBCjXk) or ways to make the world a better place for all humans. So far I've focused on transportation and infrastructure, and I'm currently working on a natural language project related to music and trend cycles. 

If you're wondering "Does this site look like this on purpose? You seem technically capable...", 
the answer is yes! It's a nod to web 1.0 design of the 90s. Everything old is new again; time is a flat circle.
