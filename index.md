<h2>hi, i'm benjamin</h2>

I'm a data scientist who likes to tell stories.

You can [e-mail me](mailto:contact_arnav.darkened639@8alias.com) if you'd like to chat about
new projects, cycling, [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKgYJnBCjXk){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} or ways to make the world a better place for all humans. I have a keen interest in transportation, infrastructure and improving local government, and I'm currently working on a natural language project related to music and trend cycles. 

## I like to learn things and tell other people about them
Read [my latest piece](https://www.vitalcitynyc.org/articles/the-lawless-state-of-new-yorks-streets){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} on using data to understand the chaos of New York City streets.

This piece was based on some of this research:
* [Identifying illegal mopeds](https://benjaminarnav.com/moped_detector/) using computer vision
* [Uncovering a gap](https://benjaminarnav.com/nyc_311/) between police claims and records on parking tickets
* Using [machine learning](https://benjaminarnav.com/nyc_trafficML/) to make New York's streets a little safer

## I like to tinker
* I was tired of checking my phone for subway departures, so I build an [LED arrival board](https://benjaminarnav.com/posts/arrivals_rgb_display/) for my living room

If you're wondering "Does this site look like this on purpose? You seem technically capable...", 
the answer is yes! It's a nod to web 1.0 design of the 90s. Everything old is new again; time is a flat circle.
