I'm an engineer and researcher focused on building AI that's aligned with human values. I am also working on research related to transportation policy, government responsiveness to citizen complaints and empowering local communities to get the most out of cycling infrastructure.

I recently attended a programming residency at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, where I worked on projects related to technical AI safety and AI governance. While I was there I built a lot of things, including:

- An [LLM tokenizer](/posts/bytephase.md) in Python that uses C extensions to optimize performance
- An implementation of [GPT-2](https://github.com/benarnav/gpt2) where I only relied on research papers for reference
- A [deepdream algorithm](/posts/dream_mech_interp.md) to visualize parameters of a CNN image classifier and developed methods to blind the model to specific objects using principles of mechanistic interpretability

You can [e-mail me](mailto:contact_arnav.darkened639@8alias.com) if you'd like to chat about
new projects, cycling, [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKgYJnBCjXk){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} or ways to make the world a better place for all humans.

## I like to learn things and tell other people about them
Read [my latest piece](https://www.vitalcitynyc.org/articles/the-lawless-state-of-new-yorks-streets){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} on using computer vision and official data to understand the chaos of New York City streets.

This piece was based on some of this research:
- Quantifying the scale of a recent explosion of [illegal mopeds](posts/moped_detector.md) using computer vision
- [Uncovering a gap](posts/nyc_311.md) between police claims and city records of parking tickets in NYC
- Using [machine learning](posts/nyc_trafficML.md) to identify strategies to make New York's streets a little safer

## I like to tinker
I was tired of checking my phone for subway departures, so I built an [LED arrival board](posts/arrivals_rgb_display.md) for my living room.
