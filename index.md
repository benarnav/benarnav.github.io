<h2>I'm Benjamin</h2>

I'm a data scientist who likes to tell stories.

<h4>This website is currently under construciton</h4>

You can [e-mail me](mailto:contactme.strvj@aleeas.com) if you would like to chat about
new projects, cycling, [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKgYJnBCjXk) or ways to make the world a better place for all humans.

If you're wondering "Does this site look like this on purpose? This person clearly is
technically capable...", the answer is yes! It's a nod to web 1.0 design of the 90s.
