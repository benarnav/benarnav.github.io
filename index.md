<h2>hi, i'm benjamin</h2>

I'm a data scientist who likes to tell stories.

You can [e-mail me](mailto:contact_arnav.darkened639@8alias.com) if you'd like to chat about
new projects, cycling, [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKgYJnBCjXk){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} or ways to make the world a better place for all humans. So far I've focused on transportation and infrastructure, and I'm currently working on a natural language project related to music and trend cycles. 

Read [my latest piece](https://www.vitalcitynyc.org/articles/the-lawless-state-of-new-yorks-streets){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} on using data to understand the chaos felt on New York City streets.

If you're wondering "Does this site look like this on purpose? You seem technically capable...", 
the answer is yes! It's a nod to web 1.0 design of the 90s. Everything old is new again; time is a flat circle.
