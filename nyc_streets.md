title: Understanding New York's Street Safety Crisis
layout: page

<h2>tl;dr</h2>
New York City's streets are a pretty crazy place, they can be fun and exciting, but also dangerous. Amid a steady increase in complaints by ordinary citizens, police enforcement has plummeted all while there's been a surge in illegal gas powered mopeds taking to the streets. Here are some things I found:

+ <u>Cops don't always do what they say they do:</u> In <b>more than a third</b> of cases where police say they wrote a ticket after someone complained about illegal parking in the past decade, no matching summons could be found.
+ <u>The NYPD doesn't enforce the law on itself:</u> Less than 2 percent of illegal parking complaints filed within a block of a police precinct resulted in a ticket over the same period, with many officer's [chronically parking](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198223000635?via%3Dihub) on sidewalks and in bike lanes.
+ <u> Complaints are up, enforcement is down:</u> Complaints about illegal parking have increase more than seven fold between 2014 and 2023, while
tickets issued by police officers have dropped by 67 percent.
+ <u>A moped illegally crosses the 59th Street Bridge every five minutes:</u> I trained a custom object detection model using existing traffic cameras and recorded mopeds frequently crossing the span shared with pedestrians and cyclists. That's dangerous!
+ <u>Car crashes and complaints are linked:</u> There is a positive correlation between the location of vehicle crashes where at least one person was injured or killed and the number of 311 complaints about illegal parking, faulty traffic signals and street lighting.

<h2>Background: Lack of Enforcement</h2>

I found that the police have been doing less enforcement, especially when it comes to complaints generated by local residents. I built a custom dataset to better understand traffic injuries and fatalities using machine learning. Finally, to illustrate the chaos that is felt on the streets I  trained a custom AI object detection model using a network of existing traffic  cameras to show how illegal gas-powered mopeds increasingly use space reserved for pedestrians and cyclists.

In the past decade, the NYPD has dramatically reduced enforcement of traffic and parking violaitons, leading to a dangerous environment on New York's streets. Like many cities in the United States, New York operates a hotline at 311 for citizens to file complaints or access a variety of city services. When a complaint is made about illegal parking, it is routed to the police.

Police also often refuse to follow the law themselves when it comes to illegal parking. The streets around police stations have become clogged with officers' personal vehicles, sometimes rendering the sidewalk impassible, forcing pedestrians, wheelchair users and parents with strollers into the streets. New Yorkers are clearly frustrated by this chronic issue, and have repeatedly filed complaints to 311, but despite this surge less than 2 percent of illegal parking complaints within a one block radius of police precincts have resulted in a ticket.

<h2>TK subhead TK</h2>
I'll confess I am one of those people who occasionally files illegal parking complaints. I've filed complaints where the resolution says a ticket was issued, but when I try to find the summons in city records, it isn't there. This lead me to cross reference 311 data with Department of Finance records of parking tickets. The only way to match these was by address, since the 311 complaints do not have vehicle indentifiers like a license plate number. While both summons and 311 records both have address information, the multiple spellings of things like "Ave" vs "Avenue" could cause issues, on top of freuqent mispellings. To overcome this I translated 311 address information into [street codes](https://nycplanning.github.io/Geosupport-UPG/chapters/chapterIV/section03/), a system for normalizing this information. These codes are already present for each summons. The matching logic is below and I feel is generous to the police, as long as any ticket was written in roughly the same location on the same day, it will count as a match.

{% highlight python %}
#311 primary street must match street_code1 in summons database
condition1 = borough_filtered_tmp_df['street_code1'] == tmp_stcodes[0]
if len(tmp_stcodes) == 1:
    selected_rows = borough_filtered_tmp_df[condition1]
    
#Check if the other two street codes match (using logical OR operator)
if len(tmp_stcodes) == 2:
    condition2 = (borough_filtered_tmp_df['street_code2'] == tmp_stcodes[1]) | (borough_filtered_tmp_df['street_code3'] == tmp_stcodes[1])
    selected_rows = borough_filtered_tmp_df[condition1 & condition2]
if len(tmp_stcodes) == 3:
    condition2 = (borough_filtered_tmp_df['street_code2'] == tmp_stcodes[1]) 
                    | (borough_filtered_tmp_df['street_code3'] == tmp_stcodes[1])
    condition3 = (borough_filtered_tmp_df['street_code2'] == tmp_stcodes[2]) 
                    | (borough_filtered_tmp_df['street_code3'] == tmp_stcodes[2])
    selected_rows = borough_filtered_tmp_df[condition1 & condition2 & condition3]
{% endhighlight %}

I experimented with different methods, taking into account the time difference between when the 311 complaint was closed and when the ticket was issued, but this could lead to false negatives. Despite this, I found that in the past decade more than a third of the tickets the police claim to have written in response to illegal parking complaints cannot be found in Department of Finance records. Overall if the data is taken on its face value, it shows since 2014 about 15 percent of parking complaints led to the cops writing a ticket. On closer inspection after taking into account complaints that could not be matched to a summons, that number drops to 10 percent. If data is unreliable then so are the policy decisions based on it.

This has come at a time when New York's streets have seen a surge in e-bikes and often illegal gas-powered mopeds, mostly caused by an increase in food delivery. The vast majority of scooters are not registered, do not have license plates and use bike lanes illegally. There has been a flurry of [anecdotal evidence](https://www.curbed.com/2023/10/bike-lane-manhattan-queensboro-bridge-cyclists-crashes.html) of crashes and close calls, with some deciding to forgo cycling in response.

To better asses the problem, I built an object detection model using footage from NYC Department of Transportation cameras to show the proliferation of mopeds being driven where they shouldn't. It revealed mopeds riding in bike lanes, pedestrian plazas and across bridges in space meant for non-motorized travel. It's imperfect but allows us to begin to understand the problem and formulate solutions beyond occational [police stings](https://www.thecity.nyc/2023/09/07/migrant-moped-nypd-raid-tasers/) that burden some of the most vulnerable New Yorkers.

In one particularly dangerous crossing, the shared pedestrian/bicycle path across the Queensboro Bridge, I recorded one moped roughly every five minutes using the narrow span. That essentially garanutees encoutering one since it typically takes longer to cross the bridge by foot or bicycle.

Although access to the DOT camera feeds is supposed to be [available to the public](https://webcams.nyctmc.org/subscribers), I was not given access despite repeated attempts. To overcome this, I built a web scraper to download static images every two to four seconds, and to cycle through a series of cameras to capture various locations. There was minimal loss of information in this method since the cameras only produce still images every two seconds. 

<h2>Next Steps, Improvements, Recommendations</h2>
+ Cameras meant for monitoring bike lanes should be widely installed and paired with software to track vehicle types. New York's DOT already has a [pilot program](https://www.curbed.com/2023/04/nyc-dot-street-sensors-viva.html), but there aren't many details.
+ New York should allow automated ticketing for bike lanes, as it already does for bus lanes. Studies of the city's red light and speed cameras have already proven it has an impact on safety.
+ Police should be required to input the summons number when closing a 311 complaint where they claim to have written a ticket. This would allow for better tracking and greater accountability and transparency.
+ New York State lawmakers must immediately close a loophole that allows mopeds to be sold unregistered. New York City must make a push to resister the currently illegal mopeds that are throughout the city.
